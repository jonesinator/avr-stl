=======

This repository contains a copy of Andy Brown's Standard Template
Library (STL) for AVR with C++ streams version 1.1.

See his post here for more details:

<http://andybrown.me.uk/wk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/>

It has been updated to compile without warnings when -Wall and -Wextra are set.
